Home work for week 5 of coding bootcamp

I began by researching moment.js to understand its functionality. I then created a separate moment.js file and created a link in my html.

I ensured that appropriate links for style sheets and .js were properly created.

I then used the HTML to create a series or rows and columns to reflect a typical 9-5 work day. I created text area for inputting activities and a save button to save the information entered. I gave a range of classes and ID's that I could then use in my javascript.

I created variables in javascript so I could obtain current time information from moment.js. I wanted to use the current hour for my scheduler so I used ParseInt function so the hour was recognised as a number.

I then created a range of click functions for different hours of the day, so it would then apply certain .css styles to the past, current and future hours. I used local storage so that when the save button was clicked, the activity information remained on the scheduler when refreshed.

i ensured that the functions were then run in the correct order so that things displayed correctly when the page was loaded.
